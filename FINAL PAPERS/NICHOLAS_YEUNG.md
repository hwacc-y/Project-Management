#Open Source EV Concept Project
**Nicholas Yeung, IS 340: Integrative Project Management, Spring 2025**

## Introduction
With the continued popularization of electric vehicles, it would seem that knowledge about this developing field continues to increase value. Compared to cars powered by internal combustion engines (ICE), it would seem that the underlying technologies behind electric vehicles are not as well understood by the general student public. This is not surprising as most of the major developers in the Electric vehicle industry don’t have active support for “right to repair” and as such even those who own an electric vehicle might not even gain more technical knowledge from owning and operating an electric vehicle. EV Concept began as an idea to build an electric concept vehicle to serve as a platform to demonstrate understanding into these technologies as well as being a community-oriented approach to learn and research into how these technologies can be further developed.

## Purpose
EV Concept’s primary goal is to serve as an active and developing platform for passionate engineers to learn and develop their understanding of the technologies in the EV space. What this means is that the project itself aims to create electric vehicles from scratch periodically to allow for project contributors to apply and develop what they have learned about electric vehicles to a prototype. The secondary goal of EV concept is to participate in various events whether it be competitions, auto shows or demonstrations, this means getting the car up and running. Though this may seem like a goal inherent to the point of the project, often the pursuit of new technologies and processes can delay work to make the vehicle functional, as such it is imperative to state that an imperfect electric vehicle that runs is more suited for this project than a near perfect electric vehicle that doesn’t run at all. 

## Target Audience
The target audience for this project are mostly students. Specifically students of all disciplines as we believe that the fundamentals to the underlying technologies of EVs should be more publicly taught, in a world that is increasingly populated with EVs. Since our projects aim to educate students and depend on students contributing to the project, we aim to target students of any discipline as we believe that majors don’t define the work students can contribute to the project. Furthermore, the educational standpoint of the project hopes to educate students outside of the traditional engineering disciplines as a form of outreach to inform the greater public of how electric vehicles work so that the public can be better informed on how EVs work.

##Project Structure
The structure of the project would be in the form of several sub teams that work on the various aspects of the EV, the projects these sub teams work on would eventually be integrated, forming the EV prototype. The reason for this distributed structure is because this reduces lead times and allows everyone to work in parallel, allowing for more rapid response to changes in design. Firstly a mechanical and composites team would be needed as we will be building the physical frame, body panels and general mechanical components that will translate driver input to the EV. Next team that will be needed is an electrical team, this team will be in charge of motor controllers, battery, battery management system and various other electrical sub systems that give the EV functionality. To allow for the communication between driver, the EV and the electrical components, an embedded team is needed to make sure the EV’s information is properly and timely communicated to the driver as well as the driver’s input to the EV is transmitted as fast as possible. Finally a business team is needed to coordinate the inventory management, funds allocation, logistics and other administration duties so that the senior members of the other team can solely focus on the engineering aspect of the EV. Within each subteam are project teams that work independently on their respective projects, these projects make up the bulk of the components that go into the car and they will periodically report back to their sub team leads to properly communicate their progress. This is important as understanding the progression of each project team allows the sub-team lead a greater understanding of where they are at in terms of integrating all of their respective projects. This information is paramount as it will be heavy depended on during the Phase 3 part of the development cycle where small integration tests will need to be conducted and as such sub team leads will need to know the project’s progression in order to plan for the logistics of organizing such tests.
